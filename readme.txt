A powerful WordPress plugin that creates a sandbox for each visitor, ideal for showcasing custom-made themes and plugins.

== Description ==

Introducing a powerful WordPress plugin that creates a unique sandbox environment for each visitor. Perfect for showcasing custom-made themes and plugins, this tool allows potential customers to experience your products firsthand, ensuring a tailored and engaging demonstration every time.

Typically, we create a single site for all visitors, allowing them to post random content that ultimately spoils the experience for others. If we want to implement a sandbox mechanism where every visitor gets a fresh setup that is deleted after a certain period, we usually have to rely on third-party services, which might not be ideal in all cases.

To resolve the issue, this plugin offers sandbox mechanism on the same server as the main site. It eliminates the need for additional servers and quickly sets up a new instance for each visitor by leveraging WP Multisite. Doesn't alternate the existing site BTW.
